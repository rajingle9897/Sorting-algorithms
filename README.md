# Sorting-algorithms code is given for following:
1. Insertion sort
2. Merge sort
3. Heapsort [vector based, and insert one item at a time]
4. In-place quicksort (any random item or the first or the last item of your input can be pivot).
5. Modified quicksort
  a.Use median-of-three as pivot.
  b. For small sub-problem of size â‰¤ 10,  use insertion sort.
  
Code for two special cases:
a.Input array is already sorted.
b.Input array is reversely sorted.
is given 

Input asked will be enter the number of elements to be sorted

For heapsort file
    input: random unsorted numbers
    output: sorted numbers
    
For heapsortspl1 file
    input: already sorted numbers
    output: sorted numbers
    
For heapsortspl2 file
    input: reversely sorted numbers
    output: sorted numbers
    
 Similarly for other files of sorting algorithms
